1. Introduction
Every day millions of people are involved in car accidents. If there was an
algorithm to predict the severity of an accident, it could enable faster aid to arrive at the
scene of the accident. For example, it could help inform police officers what kind of
accident and to send the right kind of help.
In this project, we are attempting to predict the severity of vehicle accidents. We
utilize the data given by using the number of people and vehicles involved in the accident
and what kind of accident had occurred, whether it was only damage to property or
damage to passengers as well.

2. Data
The data set used in this project can be found at
https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP07
01EN/version-2/Data-Collisions.csv. This data set contains the driving conditions, the
number of people and vehicles involved in the crash, and the severity of the crash.
There were several problems regarding this data set. Some entries were missing
crucial data required for this algorithm. For example, some columns were filled with an
“Unknown” in the number of vehicles or persons injured. To remedy this, I had decided
to drop the row as a whole as I believed filling in the data with the mean number of
cars/people would not be an accurate representation of the car crash.
